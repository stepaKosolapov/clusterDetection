# This is the cluster detector!

### You can test it on: [https://stepakosolapov.pythonanywhere.com/](https://stepakosolapov.pythonanywhere.com/)

## How it works?

We have **10 clusters** of 10 by 10 images. Each image is a **vector** of 100 elements, which represents a **point** in 100 dimensional space. To solve the problem of **similarity** of two images is reduced to the problem of finding the **distance** between two 100 dimensional points. To find the distance, the ***Euclid-Mahalanobis*** distance is used.

## If you want to use the editor used in the project see github.pages:
### [https://stepakosolapov.github.io/clusterDetection/](https://stepakosolapov.github.io/clusterDetection/)

it can also create a vector of zeros and ones from the image matrix. To do this, click the vector button!
